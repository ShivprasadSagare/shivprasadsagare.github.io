Hello there👋 I hope you're having a good day🙂 Welcome to my digital space🙏 

I’m a Machine Learning Scientist at PhroneticAI in Bengaluru, India. My current focus is on multimodal LLMs for video analytics, integrating audio🔊, visual🎥, and textual signals📝. 

Previously, I was an Applied Research Scientist at NeuralSpace, where I developed Speech-to-Text🗣️ solutions for low-resource languages.

In 2022, I completed my Master's at IIIT Hyderabad🎓✨ with a thesis on Cross-Lingual Approaches for Text Generation Tasks in Low-Resource Languages. 

I enjoy research and engineering of AI-based solutions. Apart from work, I write blogs, read novels. I also enjoy music, and try some yoga.
