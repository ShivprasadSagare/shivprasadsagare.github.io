Further, we investigate the performance of different text generation strategies: multiple variations of pretraining, fact-aware embeddings, and structure-aware input encoding. Our extensive experiments show that a multi-lingual mT5 model which uses fact-aware embeddings with structure-aware input encoding leads to the best results on average across the twelve languages.",
