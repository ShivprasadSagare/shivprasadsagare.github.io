Hello there👋 I hope you're having a good day🙂 Welcome to my digital space🙏 

I’m a Machine Learning Scientist at PhroneticAI in Bengaluru, India. My current focus is on multimodal LLMs for video analytics, integrating audio🔊, visual🎥, and textual signals📝. Previously, as an Applied Researcher at NeuralSpace, I trained and deployed Speech-to-Text🗣️ systems.

In 2022, I completed my Master's by Research at Language Technologies and Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad 🎓 My thesis work revolved around Text Generation Tasks in Low-Resource(especially Indian) Languages. 

Here, I share my learnings as a researcher and developer💻, plus some stories of my journey🌏. Apart from work, I am into novels📚, music🎹, and fitness🧘🏻‍♂️. I also like hiking🏔️, exploring cities🚏, and trying good coffees☕.
